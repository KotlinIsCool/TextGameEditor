# TextGameEditor
This was made as a school project in kotlin using TornadoFX for the UI.

# Scripts
The language for the scripts is JavaScript. You can use and modify all the variables that you created.
There are currently three custom functions: 
```javascript
endGame("GAME OVER"); //Ends the game and prints the message
goto("my.cool.game.hey"); //Jumps to the specified node
clear(); //Clears the screen
```
Note: Scripts are executed before the message of the corresponding node is displayed
